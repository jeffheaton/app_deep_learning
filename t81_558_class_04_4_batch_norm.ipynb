    "# Part 4.4: Batch Normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we're going to take a deep dive into an advanced concept in training neural networks known as Batch Normalization. The goal of batch normalization is to accelerate learning and stabilize the learning process. the same dataset used previously in this chapter. To implement batch normalization we will modify both preprocessing and a neural network setup. The original preprocessing method used a z-score standardization to make the data more suited for the training process. The model itself was a simple feed-forward neural network built with PyTorch's nn.Sequential API.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the revised code, we've made two major changes. The first change was in data preprocessing. Since batch normalization can reduce the impact of input distribution changes (referred to as internal covariate shift), we can remove the step of z-score normalization. Batch normalization tends to make the network less sensitive to the scale and distribution of its inputs, thereby minimizing the need for manual, meticulous data normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second, and most crucial, change was made in the architecture of the neural network itself. We've inserted batch normalization layers into our model by using the nn.BatchNorm1d() function. It's important to note that the batch normalization layers are typically added after the linear (or convolutional for ConvNets) layers but before the activation function. In our case, the sequence is: Linear -> BatchNorm -> ReLU.\n",
    "\n",
    "The batch normalization layers normalize the activations and gradients propagating through a neural network, making the model training more efficient. This can even have a slight regularization effect, somewhat akin to Dropout.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that the use of batch normalization may require some additional computational resources due to the additional complexity of the model, but it often results in a significant performance boost that more than compensates for the extra computation time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the introduction of batch normalization in our neural network model simplifies preprocessing and can potentially improve model training speed, stability, and overall performance. Now, let's dig into the code and see how these enhancements are implemented in practice. \n",
    "\n",
    "The modified code follows."

If your dataset is small or simple, batch normalization may not make a significant difference and might even cause the performance to decrease slightly.\n",
