    "For this assignment, you will use the **crx.csv** dataset.  This dataset is a public dataset that can you can find [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/credit+approval). You should use the CSV file on my data site, at this location: [crx.csv](https://data.heatonresearch.com/data/t81-558/crx.csv) because it includes column headers.  The primary use for this dataset is binary classification. There are 15 attributes, plus a target column that contains only + or -.  Some of the columns have missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should train a neural network and return the predictions.  You will submit these predictions to the **submit** function.  See [Assignment #1](https://github.com/jeffheaton/t81_558_deep_learning/blob/master/assignments/assignment_yourname_class1.ipynb) for details on how to submit an assignment or check that one was submitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Your task is to replace missing values in columns *a2* and *a14* with values estimated by a neural network (one neural network for *a2* and another for *a14*).\n",
    "* Your submission file will contain the same headers as the source CSV: *a1*, *a2*, *s3*, *a4*, *a5*, *a6*, *a7*, *a8*, *a9*, *a10*, *a11*, *a12*, *a13*, *a14*, *a15*, and *a16*.\n",
    "* You should only need to modify *a2* and *a14*.\n",
    "* Neural networks can be much more powerful at filling missing variables than median and mean.\n",
    "* Train two neural networks to predict *a2* and *a14*.  \n",
    "* The *y* (target) for training the two nets will be *a2* and *a14*, depending on which you are trying to fill.\n",
    "* The x for training the two nets will be 's3','a8','a9','a10','a11','a12','a13','a15'.  These are chosen because it is important not to use any columns with missing values; also, it could cause unwanted bias if we include the ultimate target (*a16*).\n",
    "* ONLY predict new values for missing values in *a2* and *a14*.\n",
    "* You will likely get this small warning:  Warning: The mean of column a14 differs from the solution file by 0.20238937709643778. (might not matter if small)\n",
